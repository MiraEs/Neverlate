create any account for anyone other than yourself without such person's permission;

You are solely responsible and liable for activity that occurs on your account and shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Neverlate password. You shall never use another user's account without such other user's prior express permission. You will immediately notify Neverlate in writing of any unauthorized use of your account, or other account related security breach of which you are aware.

**DEFINITIONS FOR COMMONLY USED TERMS.**


Below you will find clear and easy to understand definitions for terms commonly used by the Neverlate service.


**4.1) User**: the user, owner, creator, or person who signed up for the Neverlate service using your own name and not anyone else’s.


**4.2) Accountability Buddy**: the friend, acquaintance, member, associate, or person who you, the User,  select as your accountability buddy to receive the money from your Venmo account if you are late to your destination on a set date and time. The Accountability Buddy will not, or ever receive money as any kind of winning, or bet. This is simply like any other Venmo transaction.


**4.3) Payment Transaction**: the amount of money that the Accountability Buddy shall receive and you, the User, will need to pay if you are late to your set destination. This payment transaction is NOT any sort of winning from a bet, but a normal Venmo transaction done by two consenting parties. If you do not wish to have monetary consequences when setting your Neverlate Goal, you may feel free to deny access from your Venmo account to the Neverlate Service at anytime.


**4.4) Goal**: you, the User, can set your Goal to be on time to a set destination on a set date and time and to select your Accountability Buddy and the amount of the Payment Transaction by using the “Set Goal” screen interface of the Neverlate App. Before pressing the “Be Neverlate!” button on the “Set Goal” screen, you will be prompted with an alert to confirm the details of your Neverlate Goal. After you hit “Confirm” button, your Neverlate Goal will be created and saved. 


**4.5) What happens if a user is late**: if you, the User, are late to the set destination of your Goal, the Venmo transaction will take place. You, the User, are considered to be late if you are not inside the geofence, or perimeter of your set destination at the set date and time. Not being inside the geofence or perimeter at the set date and time will initiate a Venmo transaction for the set amount of money from you, the User, to your Accountability Buddy, whom you selected, set and confirmed at the “Set Goal” screen of the Neverlate App.


**4.6) Geofence**: geofence, or perimeter is a non-visible area of forty meters radius around the destination that you, the User, set for your Goal to be on time on a set date and time. The geofence will be used to determine if you, the User, reached your Goal’s set destination at the set date and time. 

**CONTENT.**


All Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. Neverlate cannot guarantee the authenticity of any Content or data which users may provide about themselves. You acknowledge that all Content accessed by you using the Service is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible and liable for any damage or loss to you or any other party resulting therefrom. For purposes of these Terms of Use, the term "Content" includes, without limitation, any location information, accountability buddy username, information about the money amount that you put at stake to motivate you to be on time, date and time information provided, or otherwise made accessible by Neverlate Service. Content added, created, uploaded, submitted, distributed, posted or otherwise obtained through the Service by users, is collectively referred to as, "User Submissions."

We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.
Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

**MISCELLANEOUS LEGAL TERMS.**


Below are some explicit definitions of legal terms: we recommend a strong caffeinated beverage before reading.


Indemnity


You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Neverlate and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to Neverlate, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) any claim or damages that arise as a result of any of your stuff or any that is submitted via your account; or (vi) any other party’s access and use of Neverlate with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code.


No Warranty


We promise to provide you with a great service, but we can’t promise everything. Neverlate is provided on an “as-is” and “as available” basis. Use of Neverlate and the software is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Neverlate and the software is provided without warranties of any kind, whether expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Without limiting the foregoing, Neverlate does not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that Neverlate or the software will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that Neverlate or the software is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of Neverlate is downloaded at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or use of the service.


Limitation of Liability


To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will Neverlate, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable for (a) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential (including loss of use, data, business, or profits) damages, regardless of legal theory, whether or not Neverlate has been warned of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose; (b) any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the greater of $0.01. Some states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. Neverlate is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. Neverlate makes no representations that Neverlate is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use Neverlate from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations.


Governing Law and Arbitration.


Governing Law: Any claim relating to Neverlate's mobile application shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. General Terms and Conditions applicable to Use of a mobile app.
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Neverlate with respect to Neverlate, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to Neverlate. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Neverlate’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but may be assigned by Neverlate without restriction. Neverlate and you are not legal partners or agents; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.
