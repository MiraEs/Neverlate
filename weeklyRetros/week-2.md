## Weekly Retro Template  

**Goals for last week**:
- Finish the proposal and submit it for review. Experiment with parts of code to test out the concept. Start building the MVP product. Create wireframes and layout in the storyboard. Brainstorm, create a draft for the logo.  

**Goals for this week**:
- Finish MVP product: a user should be able to input and store all the data required for creating a goal, a user should be able to get notifications and not/charged whether she is on time/late. Have David user test it before Friday, 20 Nov. Have Mike test it by Tue, 17 Nov. Finish the wireframing for all parts of the app and layout the Profile Stats screen in the storyboard. Create logo sketch, decide colors and wording, text description for the app. Create the presentation deck.    

**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):

  *  What went well?
    * We finished the project proposal, finalized the UI wireframes for the onboarding screen and Profile screen, set up data model and the remote database, Charles worked on the map code, Eric created the UI for two screens and design layout, Ayuna did the rest.  
  *  What should we do differently next time?
    * Communication could be better. Be available on Slack and keep teammates posted on "what you are you working on today? what are you stuck at? what's your availability?". We will do the daily (morning) stand-up from now on.   
  *  What did we learn?
    *  Prioritize working on MVP features first. 
  *  What still puzzles us?
    * Popover views, user-goal data relation.  
 
**Team Member Analysis**:
If you did not meet your goals, how will this affect the progression of the product? What will you do differently to meet your goals this week?
  * We will plan the sprints better, write out the user stories and self-assign it between teammates to make sure wee are on track with the project timeline.
