    *  Compare your work planned with what your work completed. 
    - We were on time and on track with our work, on task to implement more bonus features and solidify the app's core functionality
    *  Is the divison of roles within your team working?
    - Yes, the delegation of work seems to be working pretty well, although I (charles) have had to ask for help for some bugs that I encountered while moving my code to the main project, such as loading code from a custom nib file. For future reference, make a custom class and use awakeFomNib!
    *  Are you getting adequate support? How are you reviewing code?
    - Definitely. David has been very helpful so far, and Mike is helpful as always. I don't think we are reviewing code that often, but I do go through my code and see if there are methods or lines of code we simply do not need.
    * How can you improve productivity and get the most work done within the next week?
    Increase communication and punctuality, ask for help if you need it, just try to be be as productive as possible without waiting or trying to work on a problem that is taking too long. If it's not working even after hours of trying, move on to another feature and fix the error later on.
