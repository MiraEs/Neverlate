## Weekly Retro Week 3

**Goals for last week**:
Be on track to finish MVP by Tuesday Nov 17, come up with final logo designs and UI choices. Create presentation deck and be ready for first presentation. Logo is done, t-shirst are done. App icon is done. 

**Goals for this week**:
**Finish MVP for real**, write out presentation script and start practicing. Start user testing. Make a presetation deck for the seconde release demo. Finalize app colors and design.   

**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):

  *  What went well?
   * Finished app icon, logo and t-shirts design. Yay. Mentor meeting was very productive. Wrote out code for event trigger, though it didn't work.  
  *  What should we do differently next time?
   * Prioritize time spent on building a particular feature and fixing merge conflicts, communication, manager personal commitments. Focus and build as much as we can. Give it 100% for the next 8 days.   
  *  What did we learn?
   * Don't spend too much time on building one feature, don't spend too much time on fixing a merge conflict. Prioritize.   
  *  What still puzzles us?
   * Trigger events code, how to add the custom marker, popover size on different size devices.   
 
**Team Member Analysis**:


If you did not meet your goals, how will this affect the progression of the product? What will you do differently to meet your goals this week? 

We will prioritize our time better. 

We'll master git and github workflow.

  *  Eric
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week:
         * Finish basic wireframes, work on popovers
        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? Worked on popovers, haven't done the wireframes
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week:
         * main screen: time picker - store data from time set by a user, make the time picker work
         * Profile VC in the storyboard
         * calendar - find another pod that stores multiple dates
         * wireframes for onboarding swipe instructions
         * wireframe and storyboard layout for multiple goals in Profile VC
         * bonus feature: calendar can have a toggle for repeat: every day of the week the user selects
         * write out personal pitch script for the presentation demo 

**Additional Discussion Topics**:

  *  Compare your work planned with your work completed.
    *  We were planning to finish the MVP by Tue, Nov 17. That was too ambitious. We were sort of ready with it by end of Sat, Nov 21.  
  *  Is the divison of roles within your team working?
    * Yes. 
  *  How is communication and collaboration between team members?
    * Could be better if everybody checks in with the team on Slack.  
  *  Are you getting adequate support? How are you reviewing code?
    * The meeting with David, our mentor, was good and helpful. Mike is helping a lot, too. It'd be great to have more TAs to help out. We started pushing the code via pull requests as opposed to pushing directly to master.  
  *  How can you improve productivity and get the most work done within the next week?
    * Give it our 100%. We'll work our ***es to have the functionality and design done by the end of the week.  

Charles: 

The delegation of work seems to be working pretty well, although I have had to ask for help for some bugs that I encountered while moving my code to the main project, such as loading code from a custom nib file. For future reference, make a custom class and use awakeFomNib.

Definitely. David has been very helpful so far, and Mike is helpful as always. I don't think we are reviewing code that often, but I do go through my code and see if there are methods or lines of code we simply do not need. 

Increase communication and punctuality, ask for help if you need it, just try to be be as productive as possible without waiting or trying to work on a problem that is taking too long. If it's not working even after hours of trying, move on to another feature and fix the error later on.
