# Neverlate


**Team**: Ayuna Vogel, Charles Kang, Eric Sze.s


**Neverlate** is a self-improvement iOS app that helps motivate you to be on time. Put money at stake and pick a friend to be your accountability buddy. If you’re late, you gotta pay!  


####How it works

* Set a goal to be on time to a certain place.

* Pick a friend from the list of your phone contacts to be your accountability buddy.

* Set the amount of money that you will pay to your friend if you are late.

* The app starts tracking your location and checks whether the time when you arrive to your destination is earlier or later than the set time.

* If you are late, a Venmo transaction is invoked and the set amount of money will be sent to your accountability buddy. A user has to connect her Neverlate account to her Venmo account. Nevelate does NOT store user's Venmo account information.

We hope that our app will motivate you to be on time, and that you'll be Neverlate again! 👍 👏 🎉
