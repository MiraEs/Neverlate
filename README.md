# Neverlate


**Team**: Charles Kang, Eric Sze, Ayuna Vogel. 


**Neverlate** app helps people who are often late to build a good habit of getting to places on time by utilizing the concept of a monetary incentive and an "accountability buddy". 

The idea is simple: a user sets a goal to be at a certain location on a certain date and time, and selects her accountability buddy from the list of her phone contacts (presumably a friend who a user will see at a place of destination in person). A user sets an amount of money that a user will pay to her friend, a.k.a accountability buddy, in case a user is late to the destination place. If a user is late, money gets sent to her accountability buddy via Venmo, so a user has to connect her Neverlate account to her Venmo account. Nevelate does NOT store user's Venmo account information. 

Promise your friend to be on time, and if you are late, you gotta pay your buddy! We hope that our app will motivate you to be on time, and that you'll be Neverlate again! 👍 👏 🎉
