# NeverLate


**NeverLate** app helps people who are often late to class/work to build a good habit of getting to places on time by utilizing the concept of "accountability buddy". 


Our primary target users are groups of people who have to be at a certain location by certain time (classmates, office colleagues, gym buddies) and who see each other in person on a regular basis.  The idea is simple: a user sets a goal to be at a certain location at a certain time on specific days within one month timeframe (for example, 10 am, 550 Broadway, Mon - Fri, for one month starting user's selected date). If a user is not at work/class/gym by that time, the amount of money a user set will be sent via Venmo to user's accountability buddy whom a user selects from the list of her contacts (for example, $10 to Gabriel).
